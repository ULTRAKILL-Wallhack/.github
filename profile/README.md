## Features üöÄ

* **High-Contrast Visuals (subtle, not neon):** Gentle vibrance/contrast bump via monitor or GPU so enemies detach from particle spam without cartoon colors.
* **Zero-Noise Picture:** Motion blur, film grain, vignette, and heavy chromatic effects off‚Äîkeep edges razor-clean during slides and dash-peeks.
* **Balanced AA + Light Sharpen:** Preserve outlines and micro-detail without haloing textures.
* **FOV That Helps Aim:** Mid‚Äìhigh FOV for awareness; stop before targets look like ants. Keep any zoom multipliers consistent so flick distances feel the same.
* **Readable Crosshair:** Small, high-contrast dot or thin cross that never hides coins or tiny weak points.
* **HUD Minimalism:** Only the essentials‚Äîhealth, ammo, weapon cue. Bigger numbers, fewer widgets.
* **Directional Audio Imaging:** Footstep/telegraph-forward EQ so off-screen action pulls your attention correctly.
* **Weapon Swap Discipline:** One-press swaps for Revolver ‚áÑ Shotgun ‚áÑ Railcannon; your aim stays king instead of your inventory.
* **Coin-Shot Confidence:** Marksman coin flicks create that ‚Äúmagnet aim‚Äù vibe‚Äîno cheats, just mechanics.
* **Rail Tap Windows:** Single, decisive clicks from dash-peek angles; no over-correcting or scope dragging.

## Installation Instructions ‚Äî Build the ESP-Style Stack üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Display Calibration (2 minutes)**

   * Set **brightness** so shadowed corners are readable without bleaching whites.
   * Keep **color temperature** neutral; extremes smear yellows/reds and hide hit feedback.
   * If your monitor has an ‚ÄúFPS‚Äù or ‚Äúclarity‚Äù preset, start there and tone it down until skin tones and sky look natural.

2. **Video Options for Pure Readability**

   * Turn **motion blur**, **film grain**, **vignette**, and heavy **chromatic aberration** off.
   * Choose **anti-aliasing** that preserves edge detail; avoid ultra-soft smearing.
   * Add **light sharpening**‚Äîdefine silhouettes, not halos.

3. **FOV & Zoom Consistency**

   * Begin mid‚Äìhigh FOV; raise until flank reads feel effortless, then stop.
   * Keep any zoom/ADS multipliers **consistent** so your muscle memory survives scope shifts.

4. **Crosshair & Color**

   * Small dot or thin cross in a color that never blends with effects (white or cyan tends to pop).
   * Skip animated or thick reticles that mask weak points and coins.

5. **HUD Diet**

   * Show essentials only; trim decorative widgets.
   * Make ammo/health clear and large enough to parse at a glance.

6. **Audio Imaging Setup**

   * Trim muddy lows; preserve mids where steps, telegraphs, and projectiles live.
   * Lower ambience slightly in big arenas so cues cut through‚Äîdirection beats volume.

7. **Bind Layout (the secret sauce)**

   * Put **Revolver, Shotgun, Rail** on adjacent keys you can press mid-movement.
   * Map **coin flip** next to fire so you can flick coin ‚Üí tap seamlessly.
   * Set **parry** (Feedbacker/Knuckleblaster) on a panic-proof key your finger can hit while strafing.

8. **Warmup (5 minutes, daily)**

   * **Line Traces:** Glide crosshair along edges to kill micro-jitter.
   * **Dot Flicks:** Pick tiny decals; flick-return-flick at a steady tempo.
   * **Strafe Tracking:** Circle an object while keeping the crosshair pinned.

9. **Combat Routines (ESP feel in action)**

   * **Coin Flick Ladder:** Start close, then increase distance/speed; shoot as the coin peaks in your flick path.
   * **Dash-Peek Rail:** Dash out ‚Üí single rail tap ‚Üí dash back. One correction max.
   * **Shotgun Pop ‚Üí Revolver Finish:** Short stagger into precision tap keeps your sightline free for the next threat.
   * **Parry ‚Üí Punish:** Parry a projectile, then coin-tap or rail during the staggered beat‚Äîrhythm builds prediction.
   * **Nailgun Herd ‚Üí Revolver Clean:** Use nails to shape movement, then snap a revolver finisher.

10. **Review & Micro-Adjust**

* **Overshooting?** Lower sens a notch or widen FOV slightly.
* **Hesitating?** FOV might be too wide or crosshair too busy‚Äîtighten both.
* Save two profiles: **Speed Rooms** (wider FOV) and **Precision Rooms** (tighter FOV, leaner effects).

## Extra Tips That Feel Like Wall Vision üß†

* **Angle Slicing:** Clear arenas in slices; fewer open lanes equals fewer jump-scares.
* **Light Advantage:** Fight from bright into dark; your silhouette hides, theirs pops.
* **Information Rhythm:** After every burst, quick glance at HUD cues and sound direction; reposition before you aim again.
* **Two-Correction Rule:** If a target needs more than two micro-corrections, reset angle instead of muscling the crosshair.
* **Camera Composure:** Short, confident clicks beat long drags‚Äîespecially on rail.
